    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    const newPlayers = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    newPlayers.push('Pavel');

    // now here is the problem!

    console.log(newPlayers, players);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    let newPlayers1 = players.slice(0);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    newPlayers1 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    newPlayers1 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    newPlayers1.push('pavel');

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'pavel',
      age: 22
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    let newPerson = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    newPerson = Object.assign({}, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // newPerson = { ...preson };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
